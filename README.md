Hello!

I'm Jonathan. I'm pretty new at coding, let alone the technology industry. At least, as far as work and education go... Anyway, I'm looking into different skills and services I can offer in a 'small business' type of way. The range of work is broad, however. My 'cherry on top' is a career in the pet care business. I'm working on becoming a walker with Rover and Wag, and want to add on grooming and training in the long run. I'm also setting up to do Ride for Hire with Uber and Lyft. Blah. Mobile tech repair is the final piece for now, so I figure getting some knowledge and experience in coding could help nonetheless!

I also hold a part-time w-4 job, counting retail inventory at night, to supplement. Like so many, I've abandoned the 9-5 lifestyle. I was mainly just a laborer anyhow. This newer lifestyle has it rewards, as I'm also a dad so with most of my income being based off my own personalized schedule, it opens up much better opportunity than... whatever 'that' was.
